# calculator

It is a calculator designed with the help of casio 991es. 
But 991es calculator is exist in hardware but not in software. 
I just want to make this software as a calculator featured as Casio 991es.
It also look like casio calculator. 
I just included my stack algorithm to calculate multi digit expression.
Some math are in progress such as vector, equation ect.
Thank you.
